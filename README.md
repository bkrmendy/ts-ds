[A Simple State-Machine Framework for Property-Based Testing in OCaml by Jan Midtgaard](https://janmidtgaard.dk/papers/Midtgaard%3AOCaml20.pdf): Concise, to the point, great for someone who already knows what's the deal with property testing, but wants to apply it to imperative code.

[John Hughes - Testing the Hard Stuff and Staying Sane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi0rHwfiX1Q&t=594s): Great examples by John Hughes, the "inventor" of property testing.

[Choosing properties for property-based testing](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/property-based-testing-2/): A great cookbook-style article series about property-based testing (not yet applied to this repo, yet).
